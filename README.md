the most useless bot<br>
this bot was made for my good buddy who is named shampoo, also to make more stuff out of a died out project called *SmartTroll*.
# how to host
make sure to get all of the requirements by running this.<br>
 ```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
and then run ***bottus.py***
<br>
make sure  **if** you want new videos please put them in vids, and the main folder<br>
you may also want to get a heroku server up and running<br>

# but what if i dont want to host
well you have to i have put the invite and bot on <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2">locked</a> for now.
# what if robloxavatar and minecraft dont load the correct avatar/skin?
that is not up to me its up to the sites that i have chosen for showing up avatars/skins<br>
sites that i have chosen
<ul>
 <li>roblox api</li>
 <li>minotar.net</li>
</ul>

*fixes*<br>
for **roblox** click on image if its pending and it should show up.<br>
for **minecraft** nothing, its minotars problem.

# warnings
some commands such as *img* or some other link command might break for others such as new images every time you click it, or either different image for others than what you see.
